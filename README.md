# Machine Learning Air Quality

**Introduction:**

In recent years, machine learning has been enriched with novel training patterns and corresponding data normalization techniques. LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) is one of the most popular recursive deep learning patterns. Unlike feed-forward neural networks or convolutional deep neural networks, LSTM is extremely powerful in handling real world time series data. Massive temporal meteorological and emission inventory data available nowadays made it possible to explore the capability of LSTM models in air quality prediction. This project is a continuation of previous contributions from Dr. Fernando Garcia Menendezâ€™s Lab.
